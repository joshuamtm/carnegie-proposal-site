**Subject:** Carnegie AI Adoption Options - Interactive Proposal for Your September Strategy Session

Hi Nicole,

It was such a pleasure speaking with you last week about Carnegie's AI adoption journey. Your thoughtful approach to getting staff "from not using to willing to try" really resonated with me, as did your recognition that this needs to work for everyone‚Äîfrom your super-advanced users to those who haven't started yet.

As promised, I've put together flexible options for you to consider as you prepare for your meeting with the President in early September. I felt an interactive website would be the best way to present the different pathways available, allowing you to easily navigate between options and share with colleagues as needed.

**üåê Interactive Proposal:** https://carnegie-ai-proposal-mtm.netlify.app

The site focuses on what we discussed:
‚Ä¢ Multiple engagement options (from $8,500 pilot to comprehensive programs)
‚Ä¢ Specific strategies for the "what do we use AI for?" challenge you highlighted
‚Ä¢ Working WITH your existing AI Working Group and governance framework
‚Ä¢ Support for the performance review integration your President is championing

I particularly want to highlight our **Pilot Department option ($8,500)** which would let you test our approach with one team over 6 weeks‚Äîperfect for gathering evidence before broader decisions. We also offer **Strategic Advisory ($5,000-$7,500/month)** with weekly sessions if you prefer ongoing guidance during your exploration phase.

If Carnegie wishes to discuss any particular scope of work or would like a formal proposal document for any of the options described, we're of course happy to provide that. The website is meant to give you maximum flexibility in how you present these options internally.

I also appreciated your insight about this being Carnegie's first top-down change initiative in your 15 years there. We've designed these options to provide the support staff need to meet expectations comfortably while respecting the foundation's culture.

Would you like to schedule a brief call before your September strategy session? I'm happy to help you think through how to present these to your President, or to provide any additional information that would be helpful.

Kim (cc'd here) and I are both excited about the possibility of supporting Carnegie through this important transition. Jesse was absolutely right‚Äîyou're exactly the kind of thoughtful leader we love working with.

Warm regards,

Josh

**P.S.** The site includes an FAQ section addressing the specific concerns you raised, like getting resistant staff started and working with varying skill levels. I think you'll find it helpful for anticipating questions from your President and colleagues.
