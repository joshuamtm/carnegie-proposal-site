# Carnegie Corporation of New York - AI Adoption & Strategic Implementation Proposal

## Executive Summary
Meet the Moment proposes a comprehensive AI adoption program designed to empower Carnegie Corporation's 75-80 staff members to effectively leverage AI tools in service of the foundation's mission across International Peace & Security, Strengthening Democracy, and Education. This engagement will transform Carnegie from an organization where AI adoption is sporadic to one where AI enhances every aspect of knowledge work, from grant-making to research to strategic planning.
